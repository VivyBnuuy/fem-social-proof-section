Hi! Welcome to the repository for my solution to this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!

# Summary
This is my second project from Frontend Mentor.
I felt a lot more confident with CSS grid on this one than I did my first project! I didn't find anything particularly difficult on this one, and I used custom properties for the first time!

For this challenge, I used the following: 
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

# Looking Back
- I'm not sure if I should be using custom properties for values that repeat themselves when it comes to sizes in rem. I'll have to look into that for future projects, it seems like the same logic as colors would apply but I wasn't sure so I didn't do it.
- I wrote a few comments throughout this project - I'm not sure if I should be using more? I think I kept things easily readable and separated the desktop and mobile layouts with comments for "sections". I feel like additional comments weren't needed, but I could definitely be wrong.
- I'm not sure if it's just me, but I felt like stretching the mobile design to be wider than 500px looked odd - I feel like it should still stretch out to take more of the screen if it's available, but at the same time it ends up not looking as great and made for long lines of text instead of shorter lines that are centered on the screen.

# The End
Thanks for checking out my solution to this challenge! If you have any feedback, I would love if you reached out to me or opened an issue if there's anything that needs fixing; I'm always looking to improve!

Happy coding!
